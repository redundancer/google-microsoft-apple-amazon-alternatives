This article is ment for people who are not interested in computer science but want to keep their personal information private.

## Introduction

Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, ... constantly collect
personal information of their users. In the very moment
the data has left the user's device they completely lose control
over what this data is used for. It can be for improving the services or marketing but
also for political influence or other issues. The only way to avoid harrassment
of your data is not to give away your data. Hence, here I provide
a list with software that truly respects your privacy and
is very easy to install and use. More privacy does neither mean more
complicated, nor less features.

## Terminology
Software can be open-source or proprietary. Open source means
that the software developers publish the source code (what they have programmed). 
This makes an application transparent to experts so they can control how the
software works in detail. Proprietary means that the software is not
transparent and the user has to trust the developers.

## Mobile
### Operating system
The operating system controls how the hardware components of your smart phone work together and with the user. Android, MacOS, Windows and many other operating systems are
proprietary and therefore not transparent. An open-source, free and easy to install operating system
is [/e/](https://www.e.foundation). It is based on the open-source part of Android and hence Android APPs
can be used as usual. Check out if your device is supported or buy a new smart phone with /e/ preinstalled [here](https://e.foundation/get-started/).

### App Store
/e/ has a preinstalled app store where you don't need to registet but still can download
Android APPs as usual. However, I highly recommend additionally installing the App store
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/de/). It's an APP store that only has open-source APPs. Most APPs that I will
recommend below can be installed via F-Droid.

### YouTube
The YouTube APP tracks a lot of your data. If you want to minimize this
you can instead install [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/). In this APP you can
watch videos, subscribe without registering and also use some YouTube prime functionality
like downloading videos on your device.
